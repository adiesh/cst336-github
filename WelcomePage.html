				<p><strong>Welcome</strong> to my webpage!</p>
				<p>Since the 2017 NFL season is about to start, I thought I would write about Machine Learning and football.</p>
				<p>Machine Learning can be used to determine the outcome of many events such as:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Sports</li>
					<li>Elections</li>
					<li>Stock Market</li>
					<li>Medical Diagnosis</li>
					<li>Product recommendation</li>
					<li>And many more</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Football can be intersting since there are many possible outcomes for a game.</p>
				<p>We predict something will happen, but we have to wait till Thursday or Sunday to see it unfold.</p>
				<p>This webpage describes what is Machine Learning and how Data Scientists use Machine Learning to determine the outcome of NFL Football games.</p>
