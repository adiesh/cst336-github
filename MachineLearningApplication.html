					<p>Machine learning can be applied to wide variety of events, from elections to sporting events.</p>
					<p>If any of you saw <span class = "italicized">Back to the Future Part II</span> movie, the antagonist Biff Tannen had a book called <span class = "italicized">"Grays Sports Almanac"</span> which had the outcome of <strong>every sporting event</strong> from 1950 to the year 2000.</p>
					<p>Biff became very wealthy since he could bet on every sporting event within that timeframe. </p>

					<p>The closest thing to the <span class = "italicized">"Grays Sports Almanac"</span> would be using Machine Learning that can predict these contests.</p>
					<p>Humans tend to have a bias for certain teams or players due to previous accomplishments.</p>	
					<p>Through machine learning, we can make better recruitment to assess the best options.</p>

					<p><span class = "italicized"><span class = "underlined"><strong>The first stage</strong></span></span> of putting together a model would be to <strong>gather data from previous contests.</strong></p>
					<p>This means looking at each team's previous records over the last couple years. <strong>Keep in mind</strong> regarding the following: </p>
				
					<table>
						<tr id = "headerName">
							<th><strong>Factors:</strong></th>
							<th><strong>Reasons:</strong></th>
						</tr>
						<tr class = "rows">
							<td>Margin of the Victory</td>
							<td>How many points did that particular team win or lose by?</td>
						</tr>
						<tr class = "rows">
							<td>Points scored per quarter</td>
							<td>Some teams score more or less throughout the game. They gain a significant lead from the start, or had to comeback to win games.</td>
						</tr>
						<tr class = "rows">
							<td>Player's stats</td>
							<td>A player's rushing, passing, or receiving yards. How well did he perform against certain teams?</td>
						</tr>
						<tr class = "rows">
							<td>Player's injury history</td>
							<td>Injuries or surgical procedures a player went through. How many games were or will be missed due to injury?</td>
						</tr>
						<tr class = "rows">
							<td>Team's lineup</td>
							<td>Lineups are bound to change due to injury or suspensions.</td>
						</tr>
						<tr class = "rows">
							<td>Divisional or Non-Conference Game</td>
							<td>Divisional contests are much more competitive since your record heavily depends on wins within the division, and each team meets twice. Non-conference games tend to be not as competitive as divisional contests.</td>
						</tr>
						<tr class = "rows">
							<td>Location of Contest</td>
							<td>Home or away game? Home has the advantage. Air levels can vary. Denver is 1 mile above sea-level, while some games occur in Mexico City in recent years (7,200 feet above sea-level)</td>
						</tr>
							<tr class = "rows">
							<td>Attendance</td>
							<td>Did the stadium have full attendance? Certain stadium's acoustics are very loud, making it difficult to make proper calls</td>
						</tr>
						<tr class = "rows">
							<td>Weather conditions</td>
							<td>Wind and snow makes it difficult to make field goals. Rain makes it difficult to throw the ball.</td>
						</tr>

					<p>There are other factors you can keep in mind, but all of these could help play a role in the outcome of a specific contest.</p>
			
					<p><span class = "italicized"><span class = "underlined"><strong>The second stage</strong></span></span> of putting a model together would be analyzing social media.</p>
					<p>Social Media used were:</p>
				
					<!-- Figure out a way to shift -->
					<ul>
						<li>Twitter</li>
						<li>Facebook</li>
						<li>YouTube</li>
					</ul>
					<p>Going through these social media websites can help predict outcomes with more accuracy.</p>
					<p>The model picks up on what social media users are saying regarding: </p>
					<ul>
						<li>Injuries</li>
						<li>Suspensions</li>
						<li>Changes to a lineup</li>
						<li>Controversies</li>
						<li>Weather conditions in a given region.</li>
					</ul>
