				<p>Now that I have discussed how data scientists put together algorithms or models to get these results, I will give some specific examples of how this was implemented.</p>
				<br><br />
				<p><strong>Example: </strong></p>
				<p>Bing Predicts consists of a team of about a half dozen data scientists from Redmond, WA.</p>
				<p>Bing is the <strong>second largest search engine in the US</strong>, so they have access to a lot of data (<strong>3.6 billion searches</strong> per month).</p>
				<p>They accurately predicted the 2014 World Cup for all 15 knockout rounds.</p>
				<p>For the 2014 NFL Season, they predicted 67% of the contests with the New England Patriots winning the Super Bowl.</p>
				<p>To do so, Bing Predicts analyzed data from the previous couple years (margin of victories, injuries, stats, etc.)</p>
				<br><br />
				<p><span class = "italicized">"We look at historical statistics and see which factors contribute to strong teams and which match-ups are favorable and unfavorable for a team," (Walter Sun, Bing Predicts Data Scientist)</span></p>
				<br><br />
				<p>Walter Sun and his team also observed what social media user's are saying about a specific event (injuries, weather conditions, lineup changes, suspensions).</p>
				<p>Analyzing social media or "wisdom of the crowd" can increase accuracy by 5%.</p>
				<p>Certain variables could have more of an effect or meaning on a prediction of a game. It's not simple making these predictions.</p>
				<br><br />
				<span class = "italicized">"Our model might learn that low passing yards means you’ll probably lose, but you may find out that very very high passing yards means you actually lose because you’re behind in the third or fourth quarter and you’re throwing the ball a lot," (Walter Sun, Bing Predicts Data Scientist)</span>
				<br><br />
				<p>For each new season, and as the current season progresses, the model will continue to gather more data, meaning an increase in accuracy.</p>
				<br><br />
