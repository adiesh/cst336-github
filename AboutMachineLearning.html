				<p>Through machine learning, one can create a model/algorithm to predict an outcome of a certain event. </p>
				<br><br />
				<p>How to make these predictions, we must do the following: </p>
				<ol>
					<li><span class = "underlined"><strong>Conduct research:</strong></span> Research on previous contests to help make the best assessments. Create a hypothesis.</li>
				
					<li><span class = "underlined"><strong>Collect the Data:</strong></span> Create scripts to pull some of the data from a given time frame.</li>
					
					<li><span class = "underlined"><strong>Model Selection:</strong></span> Build different models to determine the best performance. You will need a training and test data set. Depending on the accuracy of your data, choose which set is most accurate.</li>
					
					<li><span class = "underlined"><strong>Results:</strong></span> Analyze the results of your model. Determine if other features are necessary. Compare your results with other attempts.</li>
				
				</ol>
				<br><br />
				<p>With the above, we can create a model to try and predict the outcome of an NFL season or whatever event you are trying to predict. </p>
